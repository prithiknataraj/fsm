Exercise: Running a Shell Script on a Remote System Using SSH
Consider two systems:
Local system [ initiate SSH connection ]
Remote system – identify IP address, where the shell script will be executed
Steps:
Open your terminal on the local system and generate an SSH key pair : ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
Save the keys to the default location (~.ssh/id_rsa)
Copy the public key to the remote system: ssh-copy-id username@remote_ip_address
Create a shell script on the remote system 
Echo “hello SSH” and save it as a shell script
Run the shell script from your local system using SSH: ssh username@remote_ip_address 'bash ~/test_script.sh'
Check the output
